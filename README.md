This is the source code for my personal website, available at james.danylik.com.
It primarily serves as a home for my technical notes and non-technical rambling, but also serves
as a dashboard for the things I'm up to at the moment.
It is a fork of the excellent [Gatsby-Advanced-Starter](https://github.com/Vagr9K/gatsby-advanced-starter), by [Robert Harutyunyan](https://github.com/Vagr9K), which I can't recommend enough.

It also utilize several source plugins which I've implmented myself and made available on npm:
* [gatsby-source-lastfm](https://github.com/jamesdanylik/gatsby-source-lastfm)
* [gatsby-source-anilist](https://github.com/jamesdanylik/gatsby-source-anilist)
* [gatsby-source-steam](https://github.com/jamesdanylik/gatsby-source-steam)
* [@jamesdanylik/gatsby-source-goodreads](https://github.com/jamesdanylik/gatsby-source-goodreads)

Travis-CI makes builds daily and on-commit, before depoying the resulting site to [james.danylik.com](https://james.danylik.com).  (Or will; this is still being worked on at this phase!)
